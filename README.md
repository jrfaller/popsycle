# Popsycle

A neat tool to uncover cycles between packages in your Java project.

## Installation

You have to install popsycle from the source. After having cloned the repository, please 
replace `libs/swt.jar` by the version adapted to your system. The furnished version works
for Mac OS. Other versions can be found [here](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/).

## Run

You can get popsycle to run by using the `./gradlew run` command (`gradlew.bat run` on Windows).
